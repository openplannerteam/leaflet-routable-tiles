# Visualize routable tiles on a leaflet map

A visualization of the entire Open Street Map planet in [Routable tiles](#). It is meant as a quick feedback mechanism for this project and not as a map that should be used by end-users.

In the above styling, orange are motorways, red are dedicated cycleways, and green are footways.

This can be used as well as a plug-in for the [Leaflet.VectorGrid plug-in](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.VectorGrid) that shows vector tiles on maps.
